# Stretch Break
This project was created primarily as version 1 of a RESTful api for use as an exercise library. It was built with node and cataloged on MongoDB Atlas. I used this server as a sandbox to make decisions about database organization that I will be implementing as part of an ongoing 100 hours project to create a virtual personal training platform.

I added some basic frontend using ejs and bootstrap to interact with the database. It serves as a tool for daily stretching.

## Tech Used:
Node, Express, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap 

## Lessons Learned:
* Most surprising takeaway for me was that the Youtube api was easy to use. It enjoyed learning about the ability to autoplay, loop, and mute videos within iframe.
